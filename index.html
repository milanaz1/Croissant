        Croissants

    <p>
        Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. 
        The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry. They started as a luxury product, but by the end of the nineteenth century, it was middle-class (the rich preferred a good brioche). Before the modern croissant, puff pastry was used as a garnish or shell, not to eat on its own.
